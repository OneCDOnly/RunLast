## Description

**RunLast** creates an environment to run commands or shell-scripts after QPKG re-integration during QTS NAS bootup.


## How to install

- It's available in the [Qnapclub Store!](https://qnapclub.eu/en/qpkg/690)

- [Click here](https://qnapclub.eu/en/howto/1) to learn how to add the **Qnapclub Store** as an App Center repository in QTS.


## Notes

- When the sorter is installed, there's not much to see. Find the package icon and click the 'Open' button to display the current log file - any changes made to your package order will be shown here. Sorting is automatically performed during each NAS shutdown. No need to run it manually.

- The log is viewable via your web browser but is not a real web document, so it can change without your browser noticing. Whenever viewing the log, ensure you force a page refresh: CTRL+F5.
